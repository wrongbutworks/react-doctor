/**
 * Regression for #858: a GitHub Action scan of a subdirectory
 * (`directory: UI`) in baseline mode reported every pre-existing issue in
 * touched files as newly introduced.
 *
 * Root cause: the action wrote repo-root-relative changed-file paths
 * (`UI/src/widget.tsx`) into `--changed-files-from`, but the CLI resolves
 * those entries relative to the *scanned* directory. Scanning `UI/`, the
 * path doubled to `UI/UI/src/widget.tsx`, so baseline base reads via
 * `git show <base>:./UI/src/widget.tsx` (cwd `UI/`) missed →
 * `baseTotalCount: 0` → every finding looked new.
 *
 * The fix strips the `directory` prefix in the action so paths are
 * scan-relative (`src/widget.tsx`) — exactly what `react-doctor --scope
 * changed` produces natively. This test drives the CLI consumer the way
 * the action does (subdirectory scan + `includePaths` + `baseline`) and
 * proves the two path forms diverge at the base read.
