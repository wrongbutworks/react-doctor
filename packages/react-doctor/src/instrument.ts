 * auto-instrumentation are armed before any command runs.
 *
 * Exported as a function rather than a bare side-effecting import because the
 * package declares `"sideEffects": false`, which lets the bundler tree-shake
 * side-effect-only modules. An explicit call keeps the initialization in the
 * published `dist/cli.js`.
 *
 * Scoped to the CLI application only — the programmatic `@react-doctor/api`
 * library never initializes Sentry, so importing `diagnose()` into a consumer
 * app can't hijack their telemetry.
 *
 * Configuration is environment-overridable for self-hosting and tuning:
 * `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, `SENTRY_RELEASE`,
 * `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` (`0` disables tracing), and `SENTRY_DEBUG`.
