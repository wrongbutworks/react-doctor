/**
 * Last-resort React detection: locate React the way Node's `node_modules`
 * resolution would from `directory` — check each `node_modules/react` up the
 * tree — but bounded to the enclosing repo so a globally installed React can't
 * masquerade as the project's version. Stops at (and including) the nearest
 * project boundary — the git root or a monorepo root — and returns the first
 * installed `version`.
 *
 * Makes "React is installed and importable" ⇒ "React is detected" an invariant
 * for packages whose only React declaration is a version-less spec
 * (`workspace:*`, `*`, a dist-tag) or where React lives solely in a hoisted
 * `node_modules` the declaration walks never reach — the profile of a component
 * package inside a monorepo. Matching the `node_modules/react` entry rather than
 * its realpath means a project whose `node_modules` is symlinked elsewhere (a
 * Docker volume, a shared store) still counts, while a global install outside
 * the repo does not.
 *
 * Returns `null` when React isn't installed within the repo or its package.json
 * carries no version string. A tree with no boundary marker at all bounds the
 * search to `directory`, so a dependency hoisted above the scanned package there
 * is conservatively not adopted.
