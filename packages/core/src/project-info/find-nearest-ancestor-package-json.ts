/**

 * — the working tree's git root or a monorepo root. Lets a scan of a package
 * subfolder that has no `package.json` of its own adopt the nearest enclosing
 * package as its project root, so it inherits that package's dependency +
 * framework detection instead of synthesizing an empty (React-blind) project.
 *
 * Generalizes the older monorepo-root-only lookup: the nearest ancestor is the
 * most specific owning package (a leaf workspace, not just the repo root), so
 * a subfolder of one workspace no longer borrows a sibling's capabilities.
 *
 * Returns `null` when no ancestor `package.json` exists inside the project
 * boundary (a loose tree of files, or a subfolder of a package-less repo).
