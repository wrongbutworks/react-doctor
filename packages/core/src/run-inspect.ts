/**
 * The full inspect orchestration as a single composable Effect.
 *
 * Phases:
 *
 *   1. Config.resolve(directory) → Project.discover → Git metadata.
 *      The GitHub viewer-permission lookup is forked onto a background
 *      fiber here and joined late (it feeds score metadata, not
 *      diagnostics).
 *   2. beforeLint hook (e.g. CLI renders the project-detection block)
 *   3. environment checks (reduced-motion + pnpm hardening +
 *      expo/react-native), collected synchronously. The heavier
 *      content-regex security scan is forked instead (like supply-chain
 *      below) and joined before the concat, so its CPU overlaps lint
 *      rather than blocking the event loop before it.
 *   4. The supply-chain check (Socket.dev) is forked onto a background
 *      fiber so its ~100% network-bound time overlaps the ~100%
 *      CPU/subprocess-bound lint pass below, collapsing two serial
 *      phases into roughly `max(supplyChain, lint)`. It is capped by
 *      `SupplyChainOverlapTimeoutMs` (measured from fork) so a hung
 *      socket can't drag out its join; on timeout it fails open to no
 *      diagnostics — the same outcome class as a Socket outage.
 *   5. Linter.run runs; DeadCode.run runs concurrently (forked child
 *      fiber) ONLY when the memory gate has headroom to run the 8 GB
 *      dead-code child alongside the oxlint workers — or when overlap is
 *      forced via REACT_DOCTOR_DEAD_CODE_OVERLAP. Otherwise dead-code
 *      runs sequentially after lint, exactly as it did pre-overlap. The
 *      fiber is joined (or interrupted, SIGKILLing its worker, on lint
 *      failure) before diagnostics are concatenated. The afterLint hook
 *      fires between lint and dead-code. Progress spinner labels AND the
 *      final diagnostic / score order stay independent of execution
 *      order, so terminal output is identical either way; supply-chain
 *      rides alongside without a spinner.
 *   6. Join the supply-chain fiber, then assemble the diagnostics in a
 *      FIXED order (env, security-scan, supply-chain, lint, dead-code) so the output is
 *      byte-identical regardless of which fiber settled first. The
 *      viewer-permission fiber is joined later, during score-metadata
 *      assembly (it feeds score metadata, not diagnostics). The per-element
 *      `Reporter.emit` side-channel now interleaves supply-chain with lint
 *      emits, so capture-order assertions must target the deterministic
 *      concat below, not emit order (production `Reporter.layerNoop` makes
 *      emit a no-op).
 *   7. Reporter.finalize
 *   8. Score.compute against the surface-filtered diagnostic set
 *
 * The orchestrator owns spinner lifecycle via `Progress`; callers
 * choose `Progress.layerOra(...)` for CLI feedback or
 * `Progress.layerNoop` for silent / programmatic runs.

    // Whole-project (package.json) property, so a plain diff/staged scan
    // skips it like the environment checks above — but a diff that edits
    // the scanned project's `package.json` (e.g. a PR adding/bumping a
    // dependency) still runs it via `supplyChainManifestChanged`, so the
    // change is scored where it matters. Enablement is decided by the
    // provided layer (`SupplyChain.layerOf([])` when disabled). The stream
    // is fail-open — per-package timeouts / network failures are recovered
    // to "skip" inside the check — so a Socket API outage never sinks the scan.
    //
    // The check is ~100% network-bound and the lint pass below is ~100%
    // CPU/subprocess-bound, so we fork it onto a child fiber here and join it
    // just before the diagnostic concat — its wall-clock overlaps lint instead
    // of running serially before it. `forkChild` is structured: any
    // error/interrupt in the orchestrator tears this fiber down with it, so it
    // never leaks. The collect can't fail (the stream has no error channel), so
    // the only failure is the `Effect.timeout` deadline, which we fold into a
    // fail-open `[]` + a `timedOut` marker — the same outcome class as a Socket
    // outage. The deadline is measured FROM FORK (before lint), so it bounds a
    // hung undici socket without depending on how long lint takes. (On the rare
    // timeout, a stateful `Reporter` — only `layerNdjson`, which has no in-tree
    // consumer — may hold supply-chain emits from before the deadline that the
    // returned `[]` omits; production `Reporter.layerNoop` makes emit a no-op,
    // and the returned `diagnostics`/score only ever read the joined value.)
