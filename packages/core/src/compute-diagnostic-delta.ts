/**
 * Diffs a head scan against a base scan to isolate the diagnostics a change
 * introduced (and count the ones it resolved). Matching is a multiset over a
 * position-independent fingerprint — `(filePath, plugin/rule, hash(flagged
 * line text))` — so inserting lines above an existing issue doesn't make it
 * look new, while a genuinely new occurrence (new line text, or one more of
 * the same) surfaces. Identical repeated findings are matched by count.
 *
 * Diagnostics carrying `matchByOccurrence` (resolved at diagnostic creation:
 * every Accessibility-category finding, plus rules opting in via their
 * `matchByOccurrence` metadata flag) drop the line-text snippet and match by
 * `(filePath, plugin/rule)` occurrence count alone. Their identity is the
 * flagged element, not the line's text, so editing the line (reindentation,
 * prettier reflow, collapsing a multi-line JSX element) doesn't reclassify a
 * pre-existing finding as new — while one MORE occurrence of the same rule in
 * the file still surfaces. Expression-level rules keep the line-text snippet:
 * there the flagged expression IS the finding, so changed text means new +
 * fixed.
 *
 * v1 limitation: the fingerprint keys on the head-relative `filePath`, and base
 * content is read at that same path. A file renamed by the change therefore has
 * no base match, so its pre-existing findings are reported as new. This
 * over-reports (never hides a real issue) and is rare; rename-aware base
 * resolution is a follow-up.
