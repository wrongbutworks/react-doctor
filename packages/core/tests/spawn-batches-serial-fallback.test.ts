/**
 * Covers the parallel → serial fallback in `spawnLintBatches`: a parallel
 * run that fails with a parallelism-exclusive resource error (EAGAIN /
 * EMFILE / …) replays the whole pass with a single worker, while every
 * other failure propagates unchanged.
 *
 * The fallback only triggers on a real `spawn` "error" event carrying a
 * system code — which a stub binary can't produce — so this suite mocks
 * `node:child_process.spawn` with a fake child whose first invocation emits
 * a configurable failure and whose later invocations succeed (empty stdout
 * → `[]`). Isolated in its own file so the real-spawn suites elsewhere keep
 * using the genuine binary.
