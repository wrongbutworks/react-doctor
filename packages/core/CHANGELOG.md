### Patch Changes

- [#1077](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/1077) [`9cb4149`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/9cb414905de7b360d728ca08d45167116a94ee90) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Align 30+ rules with their documented behavior, fixing the false-positive clusters confirmed by a validation pass of 2,143 sampled diagnostics against the official rule prompts. Highlights: `jsx-key` now flags key-after-spread (the documented hazard) instead of the safe key-before-spread shape and exempts props rest parameters; `no-did-update-set-state` honors the prop-comparison guard exemption; `no-console` skips Node CLI scripts; `circular-dependency` skips type-only, lazy-import, and render-time-only cycles; `query-mutation-missing-invalidation` exempts read-only mutations; `insecure-crypto-risk` requires cryptographic context instead of matching identifier names; `no-unknown-property` allows valid hyphenated SVG attributes; `no-aria-hidden-on-focusable` verifies the element is actually focusable; `no-flush-sync` implements the documented DOM-measurement carve-out.

- [#1071](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/1071) [`d353dad`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/d353dadf988c52e3037dff52eec9cf8923145364) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Detect React when scanning a package subdirectory of a monorepo, so React rules no longer gate off silently. Two additions at the `discoverProject` seam:

  - **Nearest-ancestor discovery.** A scan target with no `package.json` of its own now adopts the nearest enclosing package (a leaf workspace, a plain app root, or a monorepo root — whichever is closest, bounded by the git root) instead of only workspace-configured monorepo roots. Scanning `app/src/components` in a plain React app now inherits the app's React detection rather than synthesizing an empty, React-blind project.
  - **Node-resolution React version fallback.** When declarations yield no usable React version (a version-less spec like `workspace:*` / `*` / a dist-tag, or React living only in a hoisted `node_modules` the declaration walks never reach), the version is resolved the way Node itself would — `require.resolve("react/package.json")` — making "React is installed and importable" ⇒ "React is detected" an invariant. Guarded to installations physically inside the enclosing repo so a globally installed React can't leak in, and it never overrides a parseable peer range (`^18 || ^19` still floors to the lowest supported major).

- [#1083](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/1083) [`5d2f17f`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5d2f17f71c9fb8e0d8d649da1b26de8f5cfe6c34) Thanks [@skoshx](https://github.com/skoshx)! - `query-destructure-result` no longer classifies rest-destructuring (`const { data, ...rest } = query`) — that shape is `query-no-rest-destructuring`'s territory, and claiming it in both rules reported the same line twice ([#1082](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/1082)). The rule now fires only on the consumption it uniquely owns: spreading the whole TanStack Query result into JSX (`<Inner {...query} />`) or an object literal, which enumerates every field and subscribes the component to all of them.

- [#1077](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/1077) [`9cb4149`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/9cb414905de7b360d728ca08d45167116a94ee90) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Second-round FP/FN sweep: restore delta-audit recall regressions, wire confirmed false-negative clusters (jsx-no-target-blank, button-has-type, no-default-props), repair the never-firing no-layout-property-animation rule, reconcile no-array-index-as-key, gate RN boxShadow rules on new-architecture provenance, and skip the vulnerability axis for devDependencies in the supply-chain check.

- [#1067](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/1067) [`ce9dabf`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/ce9dabf1103f4f989bb8f9c1783a24674ba163e7) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Fix `--staged` silently scanning nothing when the project is a subdirectory of the git repo (the standard monorepo layout, e.g. `apps/webui`). Staged paths are collected project-relative (`git diff --cached --relative`), but the staged-content read used a bare `git show :<path>` index pathspec, which git resolves against the repo root — so in a subproject every read missed, the file was silently skipped, and the scan "passed" with `scannedFileCount: 0` (particularly dangerous in a pre-commit hook). The index read now uses the cwd-relative `git show :./<path>` form, matching how baseline `<ref>:<path>` reads were already resolved.

- [#1061](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/1061) [`c0c3fc1`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/c0c3fc170972876c8bbc2419b32e66b9c864df85) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - Fix a CI-gate false positive in the baseline delta: pre-existing element-level findings (Accessibility-category rules, plus rules flagged `matchByOccurrence` like `iframe-missing-sandbox`) are now matched by `(file, rule)` occurrence count instead of the flagged line's text, so reformatting the flagged line (reindentation, prettier reflow, collapsing a multi-line JSX element) no longer reports the finding as newly introduced. The flag is resolved at diagnostic creation and carried on the diagnostic as an optional `matchByOccurrence` field (also present in the JSON report). Expression-level rules keep line-text-sensitive matching, and a genuinely new extra occurrence still surfaces.

- [#1011](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/1011) [`8232e96`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/8232e967238ff7943c0cac0d0b2a2f9d349c89dd) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - Make file discovery deterministic and artifact-free, and add `--max-duration` for graceful partial results on slow scans.

  - File discovery is now identical between the git-tracked path (`git ls-files`) and the filesystem walk: the walk descends into non-ignored dot-directories (e.g. `.dumi`, `.storybook`) instead of skipping every dot-directory, and its output is sorted. Repeated scans of the same tree produce the same file set regardless of which discovery path runs.
  - Committed build output (`dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, `.next/`, `coverage/`, `storybook-static/`, …) is excluded from both discovery paths by path-segment filtering. Previously `git ls-files` listed tracked bundles (gitignore only hides untracked files), so bundled artifacts like `ai/dist/mcp-server.js` were linted.
  - New `--max-duration <seconds>` flag: when the budget is spent, remaining lint batches and the dead-code pass are skipped and the scan returns partial results with the skipped files reported explicitly, instead of a SIGTERM'd empty `{"ok":false,"projects":[]}` report. The budget applies once to the whole invocation — every project of a workspace scan shares it — and a scan whose dead-code pass failed or was truncated reports a `null` score rather than one computed from an incomplete diagnostic set.

  `jsx-no-undef` is a single-file rule, so it flags capitalized JSX identifiers
  that are provided at runtime rather than imported in the file — react-live's
  `<LiveProvider scope={...}>`, Storybook globals, MDX live blocks, or an ambient
  `declare global` in a separate `.d.ts`. List those names in the new
  `runtimeGlobals` config array and `jsx-no-undef` treats them as known. Opt-in —
  an empty/absent list leaves behavior unchanged.

  Closes [#959](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/959)

- [#929](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/929) [`5f2bd72`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5f2bd7254362109555194e43a019824478cb9ab5) Thanks [@skoshx](https://github.com/skoshx)! - fix: validate string array config fields (projects, textComponents, etc.)

  Non-string entries in `config.projects` caused `selectProjects` to crash with `requestedName.trim is not a function`. The validator now filters non-string entries from `projects`, `textComponents`, `rawTextWrapperComponents`, and `serverAuthFunctionNames` with warnings instead of crashing.

  Fixes [#921](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/921) (Sentry REACT-DOCTOR-1R)

- [#940](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/940) [`441e6af`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/441e6afb55ee154e70e56f10a79565b9fd1f3295) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Stop a scan from crashing when a git subprocess fails synchronously (fixes REACT-DOCTOR-1E, REACT-DOCTOR-1P, REACT-DOCTOR-20). Unlike a missing binary (`ENOENT`, which arrives on the catchable `'error'` event), `child_process.spawn` **throws synchronously** when the working directory isn't a directory (`ENOTDIR`) or the argument list exceeds the OS command-line limit (`ENAMETOOLONG` — e.g. `--scope lines` on a 1,000+-file diff on Windows). That throw escaped Effect's error channel entirely and took down the whole scan (reported to Sentry as a raw `spawn` error). The git runner now pre-flights both conditions and fails on its normal channel, so the existing fallbacks recover instead: a bad working directory degrades like an unavailable git, and an over-long `--scope lines` diff degrades to file-level scope.

- [#951](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/951) [`c16e8ea`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/c16e8ea6f6cd455c837d02aafedb916817a4008e) Thanks [@skoshx](https://github.com/skoshx)! - Fix misleading remediation for react-hooks-js/incompatible-library

  `react-hooks-js/incompatible-library` fires when the React Compiler can't
  memoize through a third-party hook (e.g. `@tanstack/react-virtual`'s
  `useVirtualizer`). The diagnostic carried the generic React Compiler action —
  "Rewrite the flagged code so the compiler can optimize it" — which reads as
  "reimplement the library locally" and steered users off mature libraries.

  The rule stays active (the compiler's own bail-out reason is informative), but
  its remediation now names the real fix: it's how the library works, not a bug in
  your code — memoize values you pass from it into other memoized components, or
  suppress it with `// react-doctor-disable-next-line react-hooks-js/incompatible-library`.

  Closes [#950](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/950)

- [#972](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/972) [`fff9466`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/fff946689638bab3641474b6f8712a62777934ab) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Stop react-doctor from flagging its own toolchain as an unused dependency

  After `react-doctor install` — especially via `bunx`, where react-doctor is
  declared in `package.json` but never materialized in `node_modules` — a scan
  reported `react-doctor` itself as an unused devDependency. It's used via the CLI,
  git hooks, CI, and the agent skill (never imported in source), so the dead-code
  import graph can't see it, and deslop's "ships a binary → used" heuristic can't
  read its `bin` when it isn't installed. The dead-code pass now never reports
  react-doctor's own CLI / plugin packages (`react-doctor`,
  `eslint-plugin-react-doctor`, `oxlint-plugin-react-doctor`) as unused.

  Closes [#961](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/961)

- [#1012](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/1012) [`80e3093`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/80e3093815ecc40f29442ef44b4fee9accd76e8a) Thanks [@devin-ai-integration](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration)! - Core-engine reliability and security fixes from the 20-day audit. The lint binary-split retry budget is now scoped per batch and anchored at the first failure, so one pathological batch no longer starves the rest of the scan's recovery (and drop reasons name the limit that fired). `REACT_DOCTOR_SUPPLY_CHAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` can now raise the supply-chain budget instead of only lowering it. A corrupt per-file lint cache no longer fails every warm scan until hand-deleted, and the cache now busts when the oxlint child runs a different Node than the CLI (nvm fallback). The `/tmp` fallback cache directory is scoped per user so another local user can't pre-create and poison it, and the auto-detected default branch is validated before reaching git argv. The spawn argv guard is platform-sized (Windows 24k chars, macOS 800k, other POSIX 1.5M), so large `--scope lines` diffs no longer silently degrade to file scope on Linux/macOS. A security-scan I/O failure now skips that pass instead of failing the whole scan, and is reported on the run's telemetry as `securityScan.failed`. Note: the per-file lint cache is invalidated once on upgrade (its ruleset-hash separators changed).

- [#927](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/927) [`c2ce298`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/c2ce2989add3e43d21b7f609cad975e0284b6c42) Thanks [@skoshx](https://github.com/skoshx)! - Fix crash when disable comments contain Object.prototype keys (constructor, toString, valueOf, etc.)

  Resolves REACT-DOCTOR-1Y and fixes [#920](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/920).

  The suppression near-miss detector would crash with `TypeError: bareRuleKey.includes is not a function` when an eslint-disable or oxlint-disable comment contained a token matching an Object.prototype member name. Indexing the LEGACY_RULE_KEY_TO_NATIVE_RULE_KEY lookup map with such a token returned an inherited method (which the `??` fallback let through), so `canonicalizeRuleKey` now guards the lookup with a `typeof` check and only treats the result as an alias when it is a string.

### Patch Changes

- [#903](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/903) [`627f9ca`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/627f9ca4b363f7b7a037f2a77cba1213b7d605ae) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Bound every long-running scan phase with a hard, runtime-independent timeout so a single wedged dependency socket, quadratic file, or starved event loop can no longer hang a scan for hours (production traces showed `runInspect` up to 16h and `Linter.run` up to 7.5h).

  - **Binary-split cascade** (`spawnLintBatches`): a cumulative split-time budget (`OXLINT_SPLIT_TOTAL_BUDGET_MS`, 3 min) and a recursion-depth cap (`OXLINT_SPLIT_MAX_DEPTH`, 8) now drop the remaining files of a pathological batch into the existing `onPartialFailure` / `skippedCheckReasons["lint:partial"]` channel instead of re-waiting a full spawn timeout at every split level.
  - **Supply-chain check**: a whole-check cap (`SUPPLY_CHAIN_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_MS`, 90s) fails open (no diagnostics) on a many-socket pileup that ignores the per-fetch abort — the same fail-open contract the per-package lookup already had.
  - **Dead-code & lint phases**: Effect-level caps (`REACT_DOCTOR_DEAD_CODE_PHASE_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 2.5 min; `REACT_DOCTOR_LINT_PHASE_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 5 min) sit above the existing per-unit timeouts and fold a timeout into the existing skipped-check / lint-failure contracts so the rest of the scan still completes. On interruption the dead-code worker and any in-flight oxlint subprocesses are SIGKILL'd (the `AbortSignal` is threaded down to both), so the cap actually reclaims the work instead of leaving orphaned processes running.
  - **Overall deadline**: `REACT_DOCTOR_SCAN_DEADLINE_MS` (default 15 min) backstops any phase not individually capped, raising the new `ScanDeadlineExceeded` reason on the `ReactDoctorError` union. It sits above the sum of the per-phase caps so a scan that legitimately uses those budgets degrades gracefully rather than hard-failing.

  All four caps are env-tunable so the budgets can be raised without a redeploy. The defaults sit well above measured p95, so only the pathological tail is affected — no behavior change for normal scans.

- [#890](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/890) [`350a6ed`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/350a6edc59dff4d7d4adcb6c6348144ded900d8c) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Loosen the `typescript` dependency range to `>=5.0.4 <7` so consumers on TypeScript 5 can vendor `@react-doctor/core` without a forced TS 6 install. Every TypeScript compiler API the engine uses (`createSourceFile`, `forEachChild`, `parseConfigFileTextToJson`, and the AST type guards — the newest being `isTypeAssertionExpression`, TS 5.0) exists in TS 5.x, and this matches the range already declared by the published `react-doctor` CLI that bundles core.

- [#903](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/903) [`627f9ca`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/627f9ca4b363f7b7a037f2a77cba1213b7d605ae) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Run dead-code analysis sequentially by default and scale its timeout to the repo size — fixing a silent drop of all dead-code findings on large supply-chain scans.

  Dead-code (deslop reachability) is CPU-bound, like the oxlint lint pass. Running them concurrently oversubscribed the cores: deslop's parse pool and the oxlint pool each size to all cores, so together they demanded ~2x the cores, thrashed, and the parse pass missed its in-worker timeout. On a large repo (where the pass already runs near the cap) the supply-chain pass bleeding into the dead-code phase was enough to tip it over, and the fail-open path then silently dropped EVERY dead-code finding — observed dropping all ~349 findings on ~2/3 of supply-chain-on Sentry scans, with no user-visible error.

  Dead-code now runs strictly after lint with the full core budget — fastest per-phase and never oversubscribed (overlapping two CPU-bound passes buys no wall-clock anyway). `REACT_DOCTOR_DEAD_CODE_OVERLAP=on` still forces the overlap, but the two pools now SPLIT the core budget — deslop's parse pool is capped via the new `DESLOP_PARSE_CONCURRENCY` env and lint shrinks to the remainder — so they sum to the cores instead of doubling them.

  The dead-code phase + in-worker timeouts now scale with the project's source-file count (and inversely with the dead-code core share when overlapped) instead of a flat cap, so a large repo's legitimately-long pass isn't reclaimed before it finishes; the ceiling still reclaims a genuinely wedged worker, and an explicit `REACT_DOCTOR_DEAD_CODE_PHASE_TIMEOUT_MS` override is honored verbatim. This supersedes the previous memory-gated dead-code overlap and replaces the flat dead-code phase cap with the size-scaled budget.

- [#903](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/903) [`627f9ca`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/627f9ca4b363f7b7a037f2a77cba1213b7d605ae) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Skip the deslop analysis passes whose output react-doctor discards — an ~8.5x speedup of the dead-code phase on large repos.

  react-doctor consumes only deslop's graph dead-code findings: unused files, unused exports, unused dependencies, and circular dependencies. The dead-code worker projects exactly those four off deslop's result (`check-dead-code.ts` `normalizeResult`); the other ~18 fields deslop computes never cross the worker boundary. Two of deslop's passes produce only discarded output and are the bulk of the runtime: the full-TypeScript-Program **semantic** pass (unused types / enum & class members / misclassified deps), and a set of **code-quality** detectors (duplicate-block / copy-paste detection, complexity hotspots, feature flags, TypeScript smells, private-type leaks, re-export cycles). Profiling a ~9k-file repo (Sentry) showed `generateReport` was ~90% of the phase and duplicate-block detection alone was ~83s of ~130s.

  deslop gains a `reportCodeQuality` flag (default `true`, so deslop used standalone is unchanged) that gates those six code-quality detectors — they were the only expensive detectors still running unconditionally while the cheaper redundancy detectors were already opt-in. react-doctor's dead-code worker now passes both `semantic: { enabled: false }` and `reportCodeQuality: false`.

  Measured on Sentry: deslop drops from ~132s to ~15.5s (8.5x) with byte-identical consumed findings (198 unused files, 10 unused exports, 4 unused deps, 137 cycles), and a full supply-chain-on scan drops from ~142s to ~40s. Skipping these is provably safe — each consumed finding comes from its own detector, independent of the disabled passes — and a parity test locks the invariant so a future deslop change that ever coupled a consumed finding to either pass fails CI first.

- [#903](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/903) [`627f9ca`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/627f9ca4b363f7b7a037f2a77cba1213b7d605ae) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Diagnostics are now emitted in a deterministic order across runs (JSON report, terminal output, on-disk dump, and the agent handoff), so two runs of the same repo produce byte-identical ordering instead of the parallel lint pass's arrival order. Lint scans also schedule the largest source files first (LPT batch ordering) for better wall-clock on large repos — a free reordering using the file size the minified-file gate already stat'd. Set `REACT_DOCTOR_LINT_BATCH_ORDERING=arrival` to fall back to discovery order. The diagnostics array content (and the JSON `schemaVersion`) is unchanged — only the ordering becomes deterministic.

- [#879](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/879) [`9f733f7`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/9f733f7cff1055f631d69dbc84848efa948c0d89) Thanks [@skoshx](https://github.com/skoshx)! - Skip pnpm hardening check for monorepo sub-packages. Hardening settings are workspace-level and should only be checked at the workspace root or standalone pnpm projects.

- [#903](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/903) [`627f9ca`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/627f9ca4b363f7b7a037f2a77cba1213b7d605ae) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Replace the fixed 16-worker lint ceiling with a memory-and-core-budgeted auto count (up to 32). The auto path now picks `min(cores, floor(availableMemory / 1 GiB))` clamped to `[1, 32]`, where `availableMemory` is `os.totalmem()` floored by the container's cgroup memory limit (read directly, since Node's memory APIs report the host total inside a container). `os.freemem()` is deliberately not used — it excludes reclaimable page cache and reads near-zero on macOS / cache-heavy Linux, which would have collapsed the default scan to a single worker.

  The 1 GiB/worker budget matches the per-worker footprint the old fixed-16 ceiling already tolerated (16 workers on a typical 16 GiB CI box), so machines with at least ~1 GiB per core stay core-bound and unchanged. A 32/64-core runner with enough memory now uses up to 32 workers instead of idling cores behind the old 16; a high-core but memory-starved box or container uses fewer workers so the oxlint native binding doesn't OOM (the existing `EAGAIN`/`ENOMEM` serial replay remains the runtime backstop). Past ~10 workers parallel efficiency already flattens, so this is headroom and OOM-safety, not a proportional speedup.

  The cgroup v2 limit is read from the mount-root `memory.max`, which is the container's limit under the standard cgroup-namespace setup CI runners use; a non-namespaced nested cgroup falls back to the host total (with the serial replay as the backstop).

  Note for `diagnose({ projects })` batch scans: each project's lint pass is budgeted independently against the whole machine, so a batch (default 4 concurrent projects) can now spawn up to `4 × 32` concurrent oxlint processes on a large runner (was `4 × 16`). The per-project `EAGAIN`/`ENOMEM` serial replay still backstops any over-subscription; dividing the per-project memory budget by the batch concurrency is a possible follow-up.

  Explicit `REACT_DOCTOR_PARALLEL=N` and `inspect({ concurrency: N })` pins are now clamped to 32 (was 16). The `[~N workers]` scan suffix can show more than 16 on large runners, and the `oxlint.workers` telemetry distribution (plus the wide-event `workerCount` / `parallel`) now reports the real resolved worker count on the default auto path instead of only when a count was pinned.

- [#903](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/903) [`627f9ca`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/627f9ca4b363f7b7a037f2a77cba1213b7d605ae) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Add a per-file content-addressed lint cache so repeat scans re-lint only the files whose content changed. On a warm scan the oxlint pass partitions the file list by content hash: unchanged files replay their cached raw diagnostics, and only changed files are re-linted. The five cross-file rules (`no-barrel-import`, `nextjs-missing-metadata`, `nextjs-no-use-search-params-without-suspense`, `no-mutating-reducer-state`, `rn-prefer-expo-image`) — whose verdict for a file can depend on _other_ files — always run fresh in a never-cached sidecar pass, so a dependency change can never serve a stale verdict. Output is byte-identical with the cache on or off (the design invariant), so the score, JSON report, and `inspect()`/`diagnose()` return values are unchanged.

  The cache is on by default and content-hashed (so it survives CI re-clones), and is automatically bypassed in audit mode, when an `extends` lint config is adopted, or when user plugins are configured. Disable it with `REACT_DOCTOR_NO_FILE_CACHE=1`; the existing `REACT_DOCTOR_NO_CACHE=1` now disables both the whole-repo scan cache and this per-file cache. A `cross-file-rules` guard test fails if a future rule starts reading other files without being carved into the always-fresh sidecar. The CLI reports cache effectiveness on its Sentry run event as `lintCacheHitRatio`.

  `oxlint-plugin-react-doctor` now exports `CROSS_FILE_RULE_IDS`, the canonical set of rules whose verdict can depend on other files.

- [#908](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/908) [`2cadd3f`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/2cadd3fe2cb5b0476b35b1581c0a4c99bcdf1306) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Persist react-doctor's scan caches across CI runs (plan 10).

  In CI every commit is a fresh, SHA-scoped checkout, so the project-local `node_modules/.cache` never survives between commits — every run recomputes from scratch. This makes the engine's caches survivable:

  - **`REACT_DOCTOR_CACHE_DIR`** (new env): an operator/CI-pinned cache root. The GitHub Action points it at a stable `${runner.temp}` path and persists it with `actions/cache`, so the per-file content-addressed lint cache restores across runs — a PR re-lints only its changed files instead of the whole project. Keyed on the react-doctor version + lockfile + os/arch, with a `restore-keys` partial-hit fallback; the engine re-validates every restored entry by content hash + ruleset hash, so a stale entry simply misses and recomputes (no correctness risk).
  - **Supply-chain on-disk cache** (new): per-PURL Socket artifacts are cached under the cache dir with a 24h TTL (`SUPPLY_CHAIN_CACHE_TTL_MS`), so unchanged dependencies skip the network on repeated scans — locally and in CI — removing the bulk of the Socket fetches a full scan makes. Fail-open (a cache miss/error just fetches; a write failure never sinks the scan) and disabled by the existing `REACT_DOCTOR_NO_CACHE` off-switch.

  The `action.yml` cache wiring ships as an action release (cut a tag after dogfooding). A `--print-cache-key` flag for a tighter (ruleset-exact) actions/cache key is a possible follow-up; the version+lockfile key already restores soundly today.

- [#893](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/893) [`4560b6d`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/4560b6dd39a6826f3d65476df12032cae7abfc63) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Propagate the V8 compile cache (`NODE_COMPILE_CACHE`) to oxlint batch subprocesses so later batches reuse warm bytecode. Measured ~2% of the lint phase on large multi-batch scans; no benefit for single-batch (`--diff`/`--staged`) scans. The dominant per-child cost is plugin eval/registration, which the compile cache does not address — this is a small internal speedup, not a headline. Opt out with `NODE_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE=1`.

### Patch Changes

- [#848](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/848) [`431e515`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/431e515260a209088c2305c6372249009dd95474) Thanks [@rayhanadev](https://github.com/rayhanadev)! - Stop a broken `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` install from sinking the whole lint pass, and fix the misleading error it produced (issue [#833](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/833)).

  When the optional `react-hooks-js` (React Compiler) plugin can't be imported in the user's environment, oxlint fails the entire config load — which previously dropped every curated react-doctor diagnostic too and left the scan with `skippedChecks: ["lint"]` and zero results. The oxlint error is also multi-line, and the 200-char error preview truncated its plugin path mid-string (often right at `…/node_modules/`), so it read as react-doctor passing an invalid directory rather than a plugin that failed to load.

  - **Graceful degradation:** the oxlint runner now detects a `react-hooks-js` plugin-load failure and retries once with that plugin (and its compiler rules) dropped — mirroring the existing adopted-`extends` fallback. The curated react-doctor rules, dead-code, and environment checks all still run; only the React Compiler rules are skipped, surfaced as a clear `lint:partial` note that includes oxlint's real underlying reason.
  - **Readable error:** the unparseable-output preview grew from 200 to 600 chars so the full plugin path and the underlying `Error:` line survive instead of being cut at `…/node_modules/`.

  - **`unsafe-json-in-html`** — `JSON.stringify(...)` embedded in `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or inline `<script>` markup. `JSON.stringify` does not HTML-escape, so data containing `</script>` or `<` breaks out — the classic SSR data-hydration XSS. Suppressed when an HTML-safe serializer (serialize-javascript, devalue, superjson) or `\u003c` escaping is used.
  - **`jwt-insecure-verification`** — the JWT `none` algorithm (`alg: none` / `algorithms: ["none"]`), which disables signature verification and lets any forged token through. (Detecting an unpinned `jwt.verify` precisely needs scope-aware analysis, so that is left to a future AST rule.)
  - **`secret-in-fallback`** — a secret-shaped env var with a hardcoded string fallback (`process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY ?? "<hardcoded>"`): a committed secret that also makes the app fail open when the var is unset. Skips public vars (PUBLIC/PUBLISHABLE/ANON) and placeholder defaults.
  - **`request-body-mass-assignment`** — spreading or merging request input (`{ ...req.body }`, `Object.assign(target, req.body)`, lodash `merge`/`defaultsDeep`) without a field allowlist: mass assignment (client-set owner/role/price columns) or prototype pollution.
  - **`insecure-session-cookie`** — auth/session cookies exposed to JavaScript: `httpOnly: false`, set via `document.cookie`, or a bare `res.cookie("session", value)` / `cookies().set(...)` with no options.

  All five register through `defineRule` with a project-level `scan`, carry the `Security` category and `security-scan` tag, and are silenced by `react-doctor rules ignore-tag security-scan` like the rest of the family.

- [#824](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/824) [`cf9e05b`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/cf9e05be8ee1f1781878c28b8342490ec11c176f) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Show the full file total when the scan hands off to dead-code analysis, so the live counter no longer looks stuck below `N` ([#815](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/815)).

  The linter already emits a final `(N, N)` progress tick when its last batch finishes, but ora throttles renders to its frame interval — that last frame was overwritten by the `"Analyzing dead code…"` text before it ever painted, so the spinner appeared to freeze at whatever value the smooth-creep timer last drew (e.g. `80/165`). Every file was always scanned; only the counter looked short. The dead-code phase now reads `Scanned N files, analyzing dead code…`, keeping the complete count visible for the whole (longer) dead-code pass.

- [#819](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/819) [`5fc0e27`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5fc0e270c9a15d25be96ef982755cea81065d141) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Fix false positives reported in the security and TanStack rules:

  - **`query-destructure-result`** ([#818](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/818)): only flags `useQuery`/`useSuspenseQuery`/… when they actually come from a TanStack Query package (`@tanstack/*-query`, legacy `react-query`). A same-named hook imported from elsewhere — notably Convex's `useQuery` from `convex/react`, which returns the data directly — is no longer flagged.
  - **`artifact-env-leak` / `artifact-secret-leak`** ([#816](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/816), [#817](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/817)): no longer treat server-side or dev-mode Next.js output as browser artifacts. `.next/dev/server/**` (dev source maps), any `.next/**/server/**`, `.output/server/**`, and the dev server's `.next/dev/**` output are excluded; production browser bundles (`.next/static`, `dist/assets`, `public/`, …) are still scanned.
  - **`repository-secret-file`** / **`key-lifecycle-risk`** ([#813](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/813)): no longer flag a credential/key file that git ignores — a local-only, gitignored `.env` is not "checked into the repository". Findings are dropped only when git definitively reports the path as ignored (the finding stands when there is no repo or git is unavailable).
  - **`webhook-signature-risk`** ([#814](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/814)): recognizes a delegated verification helper (a call pairing a verify-ish verb with a security noun, e.g. `isValidSecret(...)`, `verifySignature(...)`, `checkWebhookHmac(...)`) as verification evidence, so an extracted `timingSafeEqual` comparison in another module no longer trips the rule.

- [#812](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/812) [`ea3b827`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/ea3b8278996613114c9c671afe292193388741c0) Thanks [@aidenybai](https://github.com/aidenybai)! - Add a `supabase-table-missing-rls` security-scan rule. It flags a Supabase migration (`supabase/migrations/**`, `supabase/schemas/**`) that runs `create table` for a public-schema table but never enables Row Level Security — the highest-impact and most common Supabase misconfiguration, because RLS is OFF by default for SQL-created tables, so every row is readable and writable with the public anon key. It targets the same misconfiguration Supabase's own `rls_disabled_in_public` database linter flags, and the gap that turns the public anon key into the service key.

  The existing `supabase-rls-policy-risk` only caught an explicit `disable row level security`; this complements it by catching the far more common "never enabled it" case. RLS is checked per table — each `create table` must have an `alter table <name> enable row level security` for that same table, after the create (a sibling table enabling RLS, or a policy without enabling it, does not vouch). SQL comments and string literals are ignored, non-public/Supabase-managed schemas (`auth.`, `storage.`, a `private.` schema, …) are skipped, and the rule is scoped to the `supabase/` directory so plain Drizzle/Prisma `.sql` migrations are not flagged. The scan runs per migration file, so enabling RLS in a _different_ migration than the `create table` is not detected — the same-file pattern (what Supabase tooling emits) is the supported case. Like the rest of the family it carries the `security-scan` tag and is silenced by `react-doctor rules ignore-tag security-scan`.

  `resolveConcreteVersion` called `semver.minVersion(spec)` directly, but `semver` **throws** (`TypeError: Invalid comparator: latest`) on a non-range spec instead of returning `null`. Any full scan — or PR scan touching `package.json` — containing a dist-tag like `"trigger.dev": "latest"` (or `"next"`) crashed before the Socket fail-open path could run (regression from [#804](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/804), affecting 0.5.3–0.5.5).

  The spec is now validated with `semver.validRange` before resolving its floor: dist-tags and other non-ranges are skipped (nothing to score), as is a wildcard-only range (`*`/`x`/`X`), which previously resolved to a synthetic `0.0.0` and scored a version nobody pinned. Real ranges (`^1.2.3`, `1.x`, `>=2 <3`) and protocol/URL specs (`workspace:`, `file:`, `npm:`, `git+…`) are unchanged.

  Scan rules register metadata (id, title, severity, recommendation, `Security` category, `security-scan` tag) like any other rule but carry a project-level `scan` instead of AST visitors, so their findings flow through the standard diagnostic pipeline: per-rule and per-category severity overrides, inline disables, and output `surfaces` now apply to scan-rule diagnostics, and `react-doctor rules ignore-tag security-scan` (config `ignore.tags`) silences the whole family. They never appear in generated oxlint configs or the ESLint presets — they only execute through React Doctor's scan. A plain `--diff` / `--staged` scan skips them like the other whole-project checks, and the gate is now diff mode itself rather than the presence of include paths, so projects configuring `ignore.files` get the security scan too.

  - `full` (default) — the whole project, every issue. Whole-project checks (dead-code, environment, supply-chain) run only here.
  - `files` — only the files changed vs the base, with all issues in them (no compare-to-main). What `--staged` and an uncommitted `--diff` did.
  - `changed` — only issues the change introduced vs the base (the baseline delta). What `--diff <base>` and the action's `scope: changed` did.
  - `lines` — only issues on the lines the change actually touched. New: previously this scoping existed only inside the GitHub Action's inline-review-comment step; it now lives in the engine, so the CI gate, score display, summary, and inline comments all honor one scope.

  `--base <ref>` sets the comparison base for `files` / `changed` / `lines` (auto-detected when omitted). Behavior is unchanged by default: the CLI `--scope` defaults to `full` and the action `scope` input still defaults to `changed`. `--diff` / `config.diff` keep working as a deprecated alias (`--diff <base>` → `--scope changed --base <base>`, `--diff false` → `--scope full`) and emit a one-time deprecation warning; `--staged` is retained as the source selector and composes with `--scope files` / `--scope lines`.

Previously a scan hard-failed with `No React project found` / `No React dependency`, even though many checks (security, bundle size, JS performance, architecture, and the Zod rules) are framework-agnostic and apply to any TypeScript / JavaScript codebase.

  A project is now analyzable when it has source files, with or without React. A bare directory of TypeScript files — including a monorepo's `packages/` subfolder that has no `package.json` of its own — is scanned by inheriting dependency/framework detection from the enclosing workspace root.

  React-flavoured rules stay off without React. A new `react` capability (set only when React or Preact is present) gates every React-runtime rule family (hooks, JSX, accessibility, render performance, React state) plus any rule tagged `react-jsx-only`, so hook/component-name heuristics like `rules-of-hooks`, `no-legacy-class-lifecycles`, and `no-nested-component-definition` can't false-fire on ordinary TypeScript. Once React (or Preact) is detected, every rule behaves exactly as before.

  It resolves the concrete installed version of React's RSC runtime and compares it against the patched releases per minor line (19.0 → 19.0.6, 19.1 → 19.1.7, 19.2 → 19.2.6). Frameworks and bundlers that expose `react-server-dom-*` directly (Vite, Parcel, React Router, Waku, RedwoodSDK) are checked by those package versions; Next.js — which vendors its own RSC runtime — is checked by its `next` version and the easiest corrective fix points at a Next.js upgrade (15.5.18 / 16.2.6) rather than a React bump. Pure client-side React apps with no RSC packages and no Next.js are unaffected and stay quiet, and the check never flags off an ambiguous declared range whose lockfile may resolve to a patched version.

  `defineConfig` is exported from `react-doctor/api` (and `@react-doctor/api` / `@react-doctor/core`) as an identity helper that gives editor autocomplete and type-checking without an explicit `satisfies ReactDoctorConfig` annotation:

  ```ts
  // doctor.config.ts
  import { defineConfig } from "react-doctor/api";

  export default defineConfig({
    lint: true,
    rules: { "react-doctor/no-array-index-as-key": "off" },
  });
  ```

  The pre-migration `react-doctor.config.json` filename is now read as the lowest-priority fallback (after `doctor.config.*` and `package.json#reactDoctor`) instead of being ignored, so an un-migrated config keeps applying. It still emits a deprecation warning nudging a rename, and interactive runs continue to auto-migrate it to `doctor.config.ts`. A present-but-broken legacy file stops config resolution (it won't silently inherit an ancestor repo's config), and `react-doctor rules <...>` migrates a legacy file to `doctor.config.json` on write rather than editing it in place.

  Note: a `react-doctor.config.json` that was previously ignored in non-interactive runs (CI, coding agents, `--json`/`--score`/`--staged`) is now honored again, which can change which rules fire, the score, and PR gating for projects that still have one. Rename it to `doctor.config.json` (or delete it) to avoid surprises.

  **CI gate**

  - **`fail-on` is renamed to `blocking`** (CLI `--blocking <level>`, config `blocking`, GitHub Action `blocking` input). Same `error | warning | none` values, default `error`: a scan fails CI when an `error`-severity diagnostic reaches the `ciFailure` surface; `warning` blocks on any diagnostic; `none` stays advisory (always exits 0). `--fail-on` / `failOn` still work as a deprecated, warned alias hidden from `--help`.
  - `--blocking warning` now wins over `--no-warnings` (it previously silently no-op'd the gate — you can't block on warnings you've hidden).

  **Baseline — report only the issues a PR introduces (Codecov-style)**

  - In `--diff <base>` mode, react-doctor runs a second lint pass over the changed files as they existed at the base merge-base and reports only the diagnostics the change introduced; pre-existing findings that merely shifted lines are matched out by a content fingerprint (`file + rule + flagged-line hash`). The head project-health **score is unchanged**; the gate fails on newly-introduced errors only. If the baseline can't be computed (base unreachable, or a lint pass failed), the run degrades to a plain diff — all findings stay visible and CI isn't gated on findings whose new-vs-pre-existing attribution is unknown.
  - **New core API:** `computeDiagnosticDelta`, `Git.showRefContent` / `Git.mergeBase`, `materializeSourceTree`, and `InspectOptions.baseline` / `InspectResult.baselineDelta`.
  - **JSON report v2:** baseline runs emit `schemaVersion: 2` with a `baseline` block (`newCount`, `fixedCount`, `baseTotalCount`) and `mode: "baseline"`; `summary.score` stays the head score. v1 reports are unchanged.

  **GitHub Action**

  - Posts **inline PR review comments** on the changed lines that triggered each diagnostic (with fix guidance + a docs link), plus a restyled CLI-style sticky summary with linkable findings and the new / fixed delta. The `annotations` input was removed.
  - On pull requests it fetches the base commit for baselining — use `fetch-depth: 0` on `actions/checkout`. New `fixed-issues` output. Defaults: `project: "*"`, `node-version: 24`.

  **CLI flags (fewer flags, fewer footguns)**

  - `--explain` / `--why` → the `react-doctor why <file>:<line>` subcommand (`rules explain <rule>` still explains what a rule means).
  - Removed `--full` (use `--diff false` to force a full scan), `--pr-comment` (the Action renders its comment from `--json`), and the positive `--respect-inline-disables` (already the default; use `--no-respect-inline-disables` for audit mode). The internal `--changed-files-from` is hidden from `--help`.
  - Removed flags now fail with a migration error instead of being silently dropped, and an empty `--project` filter (e.g. `--project ","`) is rejected.

The previous fine-grained labels (Correctness, State & Effects, React Compiler, Next.js, React Native, Server, TanStack Query/Start, Preact → Bugs; Bundle Size → Performance; Architecture/Design → Maintainability) now roll up so the scan output reads as plain issue types at a glance.

  This changes the `category` value on every diagnostic (CLI output, the per-error headline prefix like `Security: Use of eval()`, and JSON/programmatic output). If you key `categories` severity overrides off the old names, update them to the new buckets. Dead-code findings (unused files/exports/dependencies, circular imports) now report `Maintainability` instead of `Dead Code`. Bundle-size findings now sort with `Performance` (higher stakes) rather than near the bottom of the top-errors block.

  - oxlint-plugin-react-doctor@0.2.8

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- Unify the dual diagnostic-filter pipelines into a single `buildDiagnosticPipeline` source of truth, removing a longstanding divergence between CLI and API filtering.

- Wire the `Progress` service into `runInspect`, eliminating the manual spinner `Ref` plumbing that leaked implementation details into renderers.

- Move scattered magic numbers into `constants.ts` with unit-suffixed `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` names per project conventions.

- Consolidate `isProjectBoundary` helpers and rename the event-handler `isFunctionLike` to avoid collision with the oxlint plugin's AST utility of the same name.

- Push score-surface filtering into `runInspect` so downstream consumers no longer need to re-apply surface filters.

- Add `resolveScanTarget` helper and share `restoreLegacyThrow` across CLI and API entry points.

- Emit automated agent guidance (issue-reporting links) in inspect output for AI-assisted workflows.

- Updated dependencies []:
  - oxlint-plugin-react-doctor@0.2.7

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- Inherit the `design-no-bold-heading` rule removal from `oxlint-plugin-react-doctor@0.2.6`.

- Updated dependencies []:
  - oxlint-plugin-react-doctor@0.2.6

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Add `require-pnpm-hardening` environment check that warns when `pnpm` is detected without strict lockfile settings, helping prevent phantom dependency issues.

- Cover child workspace diff include paths so `--diff` mode in monorepos correctly scans files changed inside nested workspace packages, not just the root.

- Fix Node 20 runtime dependency support so the core package resolves correctly without Node 22+ built-ins.

- Updated dependencies []:
  - oxlint-plugin-react-doctor@0.2.5

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- **Effect v4 foundation.** Introduce tagged error classes (`Schema.TaggedErrorClass`), `Schema.Class` wire records for diagnostics and reports, `Context.Reference` for ambient config, and branded `Schema.brand` paths (`OxlintBinaryPath`, `NodeBinaryPath`). All fallible operations now fail with `ReactDoctorError` carrying a `reason` union that renderers dispatch on via `Effect.catchReasons`.

- **10 Effect v4 services.** Stand up `Files`, `Git`, `Project`, `Config`, `Linter`, `DeadCode`, `Score`, `Reporter`, `Progress`, and `NodeResolver` as `Context.Service` classes with `layerNode` / `layerOf` / `layerCapture` / `layerNoop` test variants.

- **`runInspect` streaming orchestrator.** Replace the imperative scan loop with a per-element pipeline that streams diagnostics through `buildDiagnosticPipeline`, enabling concurrent lint + dead-code analysis and real-time progress reporting.

- **Collapse `@react-doctor/types` and `@react-doctor/project-info` into `@react-doctor/core`**, reducing the workspace package count and simplifying imports.

- **Opt-in OpenTelemetry export.** Set `REACT_DOCTOR_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `REACT_DOCTOR_OTLP_AUTH_HEADER` to ship every `Effect.fn("Service.method")` span and top-level `Effect.withSpan` to an OTLP-compatible backend.

- **User-plugin extension.** `config.plugins: [...]` loads additional oxlint plugin packages alongside the built-in rule set so teams can ship custom rules.

- **Security fixes.** Pin CI workflow permissions, add fork guards, fix four pre-existing audit findings.

- **Adopt `Effect.Console` throughout.** Drop the custom `Logger` service; renderers and services use `Console.log` / `Console.warn` / `Console.error` from `effect/Console`, which is swappable for tests via `Console.Console` service override.

- **Git service.** DI-wrap every `spawnSync('git', ...)` call site behind the `Git` service, then replace `spawnSync` with Effect's `ChildProcess` for non-blocking execution.

- **`NodeResolver` + `StagedFiles` services.** Remove the last `Effect.runSync` hack from `Linter.layerOxlint` by lifting Node resolution and staged-file discovery into their own services.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix vite build configuration for bundling workspace dependencies so `@react-doctor/core` resolves internal imports correctly at publish time.

  - @react-doctor/project-info@0.2.3
  - @react-doctor/types@0.2.3

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Restore `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` as a hard dependency so React Compiler rules resolve without requiring users to install the peer separately.

- [#273](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/273) [`47772b7`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/47772b7da4f6e412b09e3a4f74d888307faf74a1) - Natively port the 8 rules from `eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect`
  (NickvanDyke, MIT) into `oxlint-plugin-react-doctor`. They now ship as
  `react-doctor/*` rules and no longer require the optional peer
  dependency. The optional peer-dep surface (`effect/*` rules,
  `resolveYouMightNotNeedEffectPlugin`,
  `YOU_MIGHT_NOT_NEED_EFFECT_NAMESPACE`) is removed from
  `@react-doctor/core`.

  The ports use a real `eslint-scope` ScopeManager (cached per Program
  via `WeakMap`) - same `references` / `resolved.defs[].node.init` /
  `isEventualCallTo` chasing the upstream plugin uses. Diagnostic
  messages match upstream verbatim with template variables substituted
  in JS.

  | Rule (now `react-doctor/<id>`)      | What it catches                                                          |
  | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `no-derived-state`                  | Storing derived state via a useEffect instead of computing during render |
  | `no-chain-state-updates`            | Chaining state updates across effects                                    |
  | `no-event-handler`                  | Using state + a guarded effect as an event handler                       |
  | `no-adjust-state-on-prop-change`    | Adjusting state in an effect when a prop changes                         |
  | `no-reset-all-state-on-prop-change` | Resetting all state in an effect (use a `key` prop)                      |
  | `no-pass-live-state-to-parent`      | Pushing live state to a parent via a callback in an effect               |
  | `no-pass-data-to-parent`            | Passing fetched data to a parent via a callback in an effect             |
  | `no-initialize-state`               | Initializing state inside a mount-only effect                            |

  Parity coverage: 195 of 196 upstream test cases pass (the 1 remaining
  case is upstream's own `todo: true`, "Set derived state via identical
  intermediate setter").

  These coexist with React Doctor's existing thematically-related rules
  (`no-derived-state-effect`, `no-effect-chain`, `no-event-trigger-state`,
  `no-prop-callback-in-effect`) - different IDs, different shapes,
  different messages.

### Minor Changes

- [`5be2ead`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5be2eadd90b2248b28b228fad306808cec1bf758) - Add configuration-level controls for React Doctor's rule output. Users can now set top-level `rules` and `categories` severity overrides, tune individual output surfaces (`cli`, `prComment`, `score`, and `ciFailure`) by tag/category/rule id, and rely on registered rule-family tags such as `design`, `react-native`, `server-action`, `test-noise`, and `migration-hint` for broad filtering.

  The scan pipeline now applies those controls both when generating the oxlint config and when post-processing diagnostics, so `"off"` can skip rules before they run while `"warn"` / `"error"` restamp emitted diagnostics consistently across the CLI, score, PR comments, and CI failure gate. The oxlint plugin also exposes shared rule-set maps that the ESLint plugin reuses for its flat configs.

  Expose the GitHub Action's `annotations` input so workflow users can opt into inline PR annotations without dropping down to the raw CLI.

- [`809e38c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/809e38cebabc15c42b3c40ee8c7a753c3d7549d0) - Extract project / dependency / framework detection, the oxlint runner +
  scoring engine, and the shared TypeScript type layer out of the
  `react-doctor` monolith into three new public workspace packages:
  `@react-doctor/types`, `@react-doctor/project-info`, and
  `@react-doctor/core` ([#249](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/249)). The oxlint plugin is restructured into
  per-rule modules under `src/plugin/rules/<category>/<rule>.ts` with a
  codegen'd `rule-registry.ts` ([#218](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/218), [#228](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/228), [#230](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/230), [#231](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/231), [#234](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/234), [#235](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/235), [#236](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/236),
  [#242](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/242)). Land the user-feedback sweep ([#208](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/208)): scoring transparency hooks,
  per-rule severity + rule-set selection config options, and reduced
  false positives across the design / Tailwind / state-and-effects rule
  families. Reorganise the CLI into `cli/commands/` + `cli/utils/`
  ([#250](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/250)), and forward `reactMajorVersion` through programmatic
  `diagnose()` ([#174](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/174)).

### Patch Changes

- [`99f6a6a`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/99f6a6ad1cc41828172b26f17a84bcf2d66ff17c) - Rule-fix wave for the 0.2.0-beta.5 release:

  - Scope `no-secrets-in-client-code` to client-reachable bindings -
    skips server-only modules, public env-prefixed values, and
    locally-classified safe files ([#252](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/252)).
  - `nextjs-no-side-effect-in-get-handler` stops flagging
    `response.headers.set(...)` and locally-constructed `Map` / `Set` /
    `Headers` inside GET handlers; the same safe-bindings classifier
    benefits `server-auth-actions` and the TanStack Start
    `get-mutation` rule ([#260](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/260)).
  - `async-defer-await` no longer reports awaits inside destructured
    patterns with defaults, bare-statement early-returns, or awaits
    guarded by an earlier `if … return …` ([#265](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/265)).
  - `js-length-check-first` detects length guards anywhere earlier in
    an `&&` chain, not only as the immediate left operand ([#269](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/269)).
  - `async-parallel` is suppressed in test files, browser-fixture /
    Playwright helpers, and ordered UI flows where serial awaits are
    deliberate ([#270](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/270)).
  - `js-combine-iterations` skips lazy `Iterator` helper chains
    (`Iterator.from`, `Iterator.prototype.{map,filter,take,drop,…}`)
    whose evaluation semantics differ from `Array.prototype` ([#272](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/272),
    resolves [#205](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/205)).
  - `no-prevent-default` is framework-aware: Remix / Next.js
    progressive-enhancement form handlers, synthetic event types with
    no documented alternative, and form `onSubmit` handlers that
    subsequently call `fetch` / a server action no longer trip ([#274](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/274)).
  - New per-surface diagnostic controls in `@react-doctor/core` +
    `react-doctor`: design and Tailwind cleanup categories are demoted
    from the default PR-comment surface while staying visible in the
    CLI report and at the CI failure gate ([#271](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/271)).

- [#284](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/284) [`b34c5c4`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/b34c5c4db28539d9407fc08600e0e8c28dea67cd) - Harden glob pattern compilation against ReDoS:

  - Replace the hand-rolled glob-to-regex compiler with [`picomatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), the proven matcher behind `chokidar`, `fast-glob`, and `micromatch`. The previous compiler turned patterns like `**/**/**/**/**/foo.tsx` into nested optional `(?:.+/)?` groups whose backtracking is exponential in the number of `**` segments - a 20-deep pattern hung for over 30 seconds on a 60-character non-matching input.
  - Reject obviously pathological patterns early with a clear `InvalidGlobPatternError` carrying the offending pattern and a human-readable reason, instead of crashing the scan. Limits live in `@react-doctor/core/constants` (`MAX_GLOB_PATTERN_LENGTH_CHARS = 1024`, `MAX_GLOB_PATTERN_WILDCARD_COUNT = 24`) and bound worst-case work regardless of the underlying engine. Real-world ignore patterns like `**/foo/**/bar/**/*.tsx` sit well under the cap.
  - Surface invalid `ignore.files` and `ignore.overrides[*].files` entries as `[react-doctor] …` warnings on stderr and skip just the bad pattern, so a single typo no longer takes the whole scan down.
  - Add regression tests covering the worst-case patterns (deeply-stacked globstars and dense `a*a*a*…` alternations) and the validation surface.

- [#266](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/266) [`529015d`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/529015d1d89441c4708f49413ecd540db7c04255) - Scope React Native rules to per-package boundaries. Previously every
  `rn-*` rule fired on every file in a project whose top-level framework
  was detected as React Native or Expo - even on sibling workspaces that
  were clearly web targets. In a mixed RN + web monorepo (`apps/mobile`
  alongside `apps/web` and `packages/storybook`) the rules would noisily
  report issues against Next.js, Vite, Docusaurus, Storybook, and plain
  React DOM packages where they don't apply.

  React Native rules now walk up to the file's nearest `package.json`
  before running. The rule body is skipped when the package declares a
  web-only framework (`next`, `vite`, `react-scripts`, `gatsby`,
  `@remix-run/react`, `@docusaurus/core`, `@storybook/*`, or plain
  `react-dom` without an RN sibling) and stays active when the package
  declares `react-native`, `expo`, `react-native-tvos`, `react-native-windows`,
  `react-native-macos`, anything under the `@react-native/` or
  `@react-native-` community namespaces (`@react-native-firebase/*`,
  `@react-native-async-storage/*`, `@react-native-community/*`, …), or
  Metro's top-level `"react-native"` resolution field.

  The detection is bidirectional: a web-rooted monorepo (root
  `package.json` declares `next` or `vite`) still loads `rn-*` rules
  when any workspace targets React Native or Expo, so the rules now
  fire on `apps/mobile` of a `next`-rooted repo as well as the inverse
  layout that the file-level boundary alone covered.

  `rn-no-raw-text` additionally skips raw text inside `Platform.OS === "web"`
  branches: `if`, `?:`, and `&&` / `||` short-circuits, the mirror
  `Platform.OS !== "web"` else branches, `switch (Platform.OS) { case "web": … }`
  case bodies, and the `web` arm of `Platform.select({ web: …, default: … })`.
  Optional chaining (`Platform?.OS`) and the TS non-null assertion
  (`Platform.OS!`) parse the same way as the bare form. The walker stops
  at function and `Program` boundaries so JSX defined inside a callback
  hoisted out of a `Platform.OS` branch does not inherit the parent
  guard.

  Native-only file extensions (`.ios.tsx`, `.android.tsx`, `.native.tsx`)
  keep the rule active even when the surrounding package classification
  is ambiguous.

- [`99f6a6a`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/99f6a6ad1cc41828172b26f17a84bcf2d66ff17c) - False-positive sweep across the rule plugin and the oxlint runner:

  - Gate React-19-only rules on the detected React major version so they
    stay silent on React 18 projects, with hardened catalog / peer-range /
    workspace traversal in `@react-doctor/project-info` ([#254](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/254)).
  - Treat early-return guards as render-reachable state reads so
    `rerender-state-only-in-handlers` / `no-event-trigger-state` stop
    recommending `useRef` for state that gates render output ([#255](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/255)).
  - Narrow `no-effect-event-handler` - DOM imperatives, prop callbacks
    invoked from effects, and side effects routed through a stable ref
    are no longer reclassified as handler-only ([#256](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/256)).
  - Suppress rules-of-hooks diagnostics on locally-defined `useX`
    helpers that are not React hooks, and add the `no-em-dash-in-jsx-text`
    / `no-three-period-ellipsis` typography rules ([#257](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/257)).
  - Collapse duplicate oxlint diagnostics and recover diagnostics from
    large monorepo projects via batched runs + a new
    `dedupe-diagnostics` helper in `@react-doctor/core` ([#262](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/issues/262)).

- Updated dependencies [[`99f6a6a`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/99f6a6ad1cc41828172b26f17a84bcf2d66ff17c), [`529015d`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/529015d1d89441c4708f49413ecd540db7c04255), [`5be2ead`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/5be2eadd90b2248b28b228fad306808cec1bf758), [`99f6a6a`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/99f6a6ad1cc41828172b26f17a84bcf2d66ff17c), [`809e38c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/809e38cebabc15c42b3c40ee8c7a753c3d7549d0)]:

### Patch Changes

- [#252](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/252) [`2d90c1c`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/2d90c1c5ae6d901913a575d40a784058478479ec) - Add public env-prefix detection (`get-public-env-prefix.ts`) and a
  recommendation builder (`build-no-secrets-recommendation.ts`) so
  client-secret diagnostics are scoped to actually client-reachable
  bindings instead of every string literal in the project.
  `run-oxlint.ts` and `runners/oxlint/config.ts` pass the detected

  `diagnostic-surface.ts` (the `DiagnosticSurface` type - `pr-comment`,
  `cli`, `ci-failure-gate`), `filter-for-surface.ts` (filter a

  Native-only file extensions (`.ios.tsx`, `.android.tsx`, `.native.tsx`)
  keep the rule active even when the surrounding package classification
  is ambiguous.

### Minor Changes

- [#249](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/249) [`f0198e2`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/f0198e2f2d9560a15bdb4a78f4a378ca2ac5fcdd) - **New public package.** Extracted from the `react-doctor` monolith
  in [#249](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/249).
  Public surface: the oxlint runner family
  (`runners/oxlint/{config,capabilities,resolve-use-call-binding}.ts`,
  `run-oxlint`, `apply-ignore-overrides`, `batch-include-paths`),
  scoring (`calculate-score`), config validation
  (`validate-config-types`, `can-oxlint-extend-config`), diagnostic
  combination / dedupe / JSON reports (`combine-diagnostics`,
  `dedupe-diagnostics`, `build-json-report`,
  `build-json-report-error`), and the
  `check-reduced-motion` / `collect-ignore-patterns` /
  `list-source-files` helpers. Consumers that previously reached into
  `react-doctor/src/utils/*` should switch to importing from
  `@react-doctor/core`.

### Patch Changes

- [#208](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/208) [`8556b31`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/8556b31d8e4e165f791db0aa60a6b038b18ec777) - **User-feedback sweep.** Surface each rule's contribution to the
  project score via the new scoring transparency hooks, accept
  per-rule severity overrides, and accept a `ruleSet` selector from
  config - all without changing the public `diagnose()` signature.

- [#254](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/254) [`bfaf9c9`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/bfaf9c9530a9f8761df6e2d69abcf44c1699ff77) - `runners/oxlint/capabilities.ts` now consults the detected React
  major version when deciding which capability flags to enable. The
  React-19-only rule families are switched off on React 18 projects
  so the runner stops emitting rules the project can't act on.

- [#257](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/257) [`ffbd20f`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/ffbd20f3d0ebda2221d2ea93f87342165da90fdb) - Adds `runners/oxlint/resolve-use-call-binding.ts` (619 LOC binding
  resolver) and `runners/oxlint/should-suppress-local-use-hook-diagnostic.ts`
  so the runner can post-filter rules-of-hooks diagnostics that point
  at locally-defined `useX` helpers (not actually React hooks).

- [#262](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/pull/262) [`bca5d30`](https://github.com/millionco/react-doctor/commit/bca5d30fc549a16c4628001dcd2c5a83e85c04f8) - Eval-driven oxlint robustness pass. `run-oxlint.ts` now batches
  include paths via the new `list-source-files` helper instead of
  globbing the universe, `utils/dedupe-diagnostics.ts` collapses
  duplicate diagnostics emitted across batched runs, and the runner
  recovers diagnostics from large monorepo projects that previously
  silently dropped output. Backed by `dedupe-diagnostics.test.ts`,
  `oxlint-batching.test.ts`, and `build-json-report.test.ts`.
