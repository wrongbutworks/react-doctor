// Rules whose verdict for a file can depend on the content of OTHER files at
// lint time. The per-file lint cache (`@react-doctor/core`'s `file-lint-cache`)
// keys cached diagnostics on a single file's own content, so it would serve
// STALE results for these rules when a dependency file changes. They are
// therefore run in a separate "sidecar" pass whose caching is guarded by
// per-file dependency fingerprints (`cross-file-dependencies.ts`) rather than
// content alone — a rule here without a dependency collector re-lints every
// file on every scan.
//
// Two flavors live here:
//   - Source-file readers — resolve imports / walk ancestor layouts and read
//     OTHER source files (`no-barrel-import`, the two `nextjs-*` rules,
//     `no-mutating-reducer-state`, and `rn-no-raw-text`, which resolves an
//     imported component to see whether it forwards its children into a
//     `<Text>` or a non-text host).
//   - Project-config readers — these classify the owning package by reading
//     the nearest `package.json`. That input is not folded into the ruleset
//     hash, so they are carved here too. `rn-prefer-expo-image` reads the
//     package-platform classification; `no-dynamic-import-path` and
//     `no-full-lodash-import` read the manifest's `bin` field
//     (`is-inside-node-cli-package.ts`); `prefer-dynamic-import` reads the
//     publishable-library shape (`is-published-library-package.ts`);
//     `rendering-hydration-mismatch-time` reads the package-platform
//     classification to skip React Native files;
//     `rn-no-legacy-shadow-styles` and `rn-style-prefer-boxshadow` read the
//     manifest's react-native version plus `android/gradle.properties` and
//     static Expo app configs (`is-legacy-arch-react-native-file.ts`) to stay
//     silent on legacy-architecture apps where `boxShadow` is unsupported.
//
// `cross-file-rule-ids.test.ts` reproduces the transitive import-graph
// analysis and fails if a rule reaching a cross-file primitive is missing from
// this set — turning a future silent staleness bug into a failing test. It
// also forces every rule here into the bounded/unbounded classification in
// `cross-file-dependencies.ts`.
